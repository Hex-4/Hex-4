oh, hey there! i'm hex4. i make stuff.

The web these days kinda feels boring - almost everything is centralized on a few platforms whose purpose is to make money. I'm trying to bring back ✨*the old web*✨, where people made things _just beacause they could._

[i dunno what to put here. will prob add smth later. check out my mess of repos in the meanwhile. or don't, most of them are unfinished.]
